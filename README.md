## 🌍 Overview

**OmniSight-XR** is an **offline AI-powered disaster response system** designed to assist first responders during emergencies such as earthquakes, building collapses, fires, and industrial accidents.

The system combines **environmental sensors**, **edge AI**, and **real-time communication** to help rescue teams quickly identify hazardous conditions and locate trapped victims without relying on internet connectivity.

It uses an **Arduino UNO Q** to monitor temperature, humidity, and gas levels, a **Snapdragon X Elite laptop** to perform on-device AI inference and coordinate the system, and a **OnePlus smartphone** to stream live video and display rescue information. All devices communicate over a **local Wi-Fi network**, ensuring reliable operation even when cellular and internet services are unavailable.

OmniSight-XR is built with a **modular, scalable architecture**, allowing the sensing unit to be carried by a rescue worker or integrated into future platforms such as drones or autonomous rescue robots.

## ❗ Problem

During disasters such as earthquakes, building collapses, fires, and industrial accidents, rescue teams often face limited visibility, hazardous environments, and disrupted communication networks.

Without reliable information, responders may unknowingly enter dangerous areas with toxic gas, extreme temperatures, or unstable conditions, putting both victims and rescuers at risk.

Most existing solutions rely on expensive equipment or cloud connectivity, making them difficult to deploy when internet access is unavailable.

There is a need for an affordable, portable, and **offline-first** system that can detect hazards, identify victims, and provide real-time situational awareness to rescue teams.

## 💡 Solution

OmniSight-XR provides an **offline, AI-powered disaster response platform** that connects multiple devices into a single rescue ecosystem.

- **Arduino UNO Q** continuously monitors **temperature, humidity, and hazardous gas levels**.
- **OnePlus smartphone** captures and streams live video of the disaster site.
- **Snapdragon X Elite laptop** performs **on-device AI person detection**, combines camera and sensor data, and evaluates the overall risk.
- The processed information is sent to a **live mobile dashboard** over a **local Wi-Fi network**, allowing rescue teams to monitor the situation in real time.

Since all communication and AI processing happen **locally**, OmniSight-XR continues to operate even when internet or cellular networks are unavailable, making it reliable for disaster response scenarios.
